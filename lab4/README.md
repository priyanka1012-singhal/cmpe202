Explanation
Patterns used:

1. Observer Pattern
2. Chain of Responsibility 

Observer Pattern
Subject - Table
Observer - Waiter

Observer Pattern plays and important role in notifying the Waiter object when the Table object has state = 'Available'. Control then goes to the Waiter's update method to check conditions such as party size and table size for table assignment.

Chain of Responsibility Pattern
Chain interface has 2 methods setNext() and performTask()
Chain interface is implemented by Customer class. We are chaining the different objects of Customer class here. So that if the waiter notifies the customer and he chooses leave or if the table Size is smaller than the party Size then chain is set to the next customer object (or Chain object).
